## üé¨ **What To Say In Sales Conversations**

### **Positioning Statement**:
> "Unlike other AI consultants in Hawaii who charge $5,000/month for general automation, I specialize in one thing: capturing missed calls that become revenue for service businesses. I'm a Master NLP Coach - I understand conversation psychology, not just code. That's why my AI sounds human and converts."

### **When Compared To Competitors**:
> "Most AI consultants are tech agencies building generic chatbots. I'm a business owner who faced the same problem you do. I built this for my own businesses first. You're not getting an account manager - you work directly with me."

### **Price Objection**:
> "Other AI consultants charge $5,000/month or unpredictable usage fees of $0.50 per conversation. My founding client rate is $497 - flat, predictable. Plus, I guarantee 3X ROI. If you don't capture $1,491 in 90 days, next 3 months free."

### **Why Now**:
> "I'm capping this at 8 founding clients because I work directly with each one. After these spots fill, pricing goes to $997/month and I'll have waitlist. Get in now at 50% off and help shape the product for Hawaii businesses."
