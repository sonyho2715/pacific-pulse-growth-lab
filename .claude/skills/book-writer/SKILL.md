## Writing Principles

### Show, Don't Tell
**Tell:** "She was angry."
**Show:** "Her fists clenched. She slammed the door, rattling the windows."

**Tell:** "The meeting was boring."
**Show:** "Eyes glazed over as the presenter droned through slide 47 of 93."

### Active Voice
**Passive:** "The book was written by the author."
**Active:** "The author wrote the book."

**Passive:** "Mistakes were made."
**Active:** "I made mistakes."

### Specific Details
**Vague:** "He had a nice car."
**Specific:** "He drove a midnight blue 1967 Mustang with chrome exhaust pipes."

**Vague:** "She felt bad about what happened."
**Specific:** "Guilt twisted her stomach every time she passed his empty desk."

### Varied Sentence Structure
Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, flowing ones.

**Example:**
"She ran. The footsteps behind her grew louder, echoing off the brick walls of the narrow alley. Her heart pounded. Where could she hide?"

### Strong Verbs
Replace weak verbs + adverbs with strong verbs.

**Weak:** "He walked slowly."
**Strong:** "He trudged." or "He shuffled."

**Weak:** "She said loudly."
**Strong:** "She shouted." or "She bellowed."

## Character Development (Fiction)

### Character Arc
- **Beginning**: Flawed or incomplete
- **Middle**: Challenged and changed
- **End**: Transformed

### Character Dimensions
**Physical**: Age, appearance, mannerisms
**Psychological**: Fears, desires, beliefs
**Social**: Relationships, status, roles
**Backstory**: Past events shaping present

### Character Voice
Each character should:
- Have distinct speech patterns
- Use vocabulary that fits background
- Have unique worldview
- React consistently with personality

## Dialogue Writing

### Good Dialogue Should:
- Reveal character
- Advance plot
- Create conflict or tension
- Sound natural (but tighter than real speech)
- Use subtext (what's unsaid)

### Dialogue Tags
- Use "said" most of the time (invisible to readers)
- Avoid adverbs ("she said angrily" → show it through words/actions)
- Use action beats for variety

**Example:**
```
"I can't believe you did that." Sarah crossed her arms.
"I had no choice." John wouldn't meet her eyes.
"There's always a choice."
```

### Dialogue Format
- New speaker = new paragraph
- Punctuation inside quotes
- Action beats in same paragraph as speaker

## Non-Fiction Writing Techniques

### The Framework Method
Present a memorable system readers can apply:
- Give it a name (The 5 P's, The GROW Model)
- Make it an acronym when possible
- Each element gets its own section/chapter
- Provide examples for each part

### The Story Approach
Structure around narrative:
- Open with compelling personal story
- Extract lessons from the story
- Connect to reader's situation
- Provide actionable steps
- Close with transformation story

### The Problem-Solution Model
- Identify specific problem
- Explain why it matters
- Show failed solutions
- Present your solution
- Prove it works (examples, data)
- Guide implementation

### The Research-Based Approach
- Present surprising research or data
- Explain implications
- Connect to reader's life
- Provide science-backed strategies
- Include studies and citations

## Opening Hooks

### Start With Action
**Example:**
"The email arrived at 3:47 AM. By 4:15, my entire business had collapsed."

### Start With a Question
**Example:**
"What if everything you know about productivity is wrong?"

### Start With a Bold Statement
**Example:**
"I failed more in one year than most people do in a lifetime. And it saved my career."

### Start With Setting/Atmosphere
**Example:**
"The basement smelled of mildew and forgotten dreams. Boxes of unsold inventory stacked to the ceiling."

## Maintaining Reader Engagement

### Vary Chapter Length
- Most chapters: 2,500-5,000 words
- Occasional short chapter (500-1,000 words) for impact
- Occasional long chapter (6,000-8,000 words) for deep dives

### Use Cliffhangers
End chapters with:
- Unanswered questions
- Surprising revelations
- Moments of tension
- Preview of next chapter's value

### Layer in Stories
**Macro stories**: Overarching narrative of the book
**Micro stories**: Short anecdotes within chapters
**Case studies**: Detailed examples
**Personal vignettes**: Brief personal moments

### Break Up Text
- Subheadings every 500-800 words
- Bullet points and lists
- Pull quotes or key insights
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences)
- Occasional single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis

6. **Passive voice overuse**: Use active voice
7. **Repetitive sentence structure**: Vary length and pattern
