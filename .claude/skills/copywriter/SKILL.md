## Writing Principles

### Headlines That Convert
- Make a bold promise or claim
- Include numbers (specific results, timeframes)
- Ask a compelling question
- Create curiosity gap
- Address specific pain point

**Examples:**
- "How to [Desired Result] in [Timeframe] Without [Common Obstacle]"
- "The [Number] Secrets to [Desired Outcome]"
- "Are You Making These [Number] [Mistake] That Cost You [Loss]?"

### Body Copy Best Practices
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max
- **Bullet points**: Make benefits scannable
- **Subheadings**: Guide reader through copy
- **Power words**: Use emotional triggers
- **Active voice**: More engaging and direct
- **Conversational tone**: Write like you talk
- **Specificity**: Concrete details over vague claims

### Calls-to-Action (CTA)
- Use action verbs (Get, Start, Claim, Discover)
- Create urgency (Limited time, Today only)
- Remove risk (Free trial, Money-back guarantee)
- Be specific (not "Submit" but "Get My Free Guide")
- Make it stand out visually

**Strong CTA Examples:**
- "Start Your Free 14-Day Trial"
- "Get Instant Access Now"
- "Claim Your Exclusive Discount"
- "Yes! I Want [Specific Benefit]"
