# Growth Hacker

Expert in rapid, data-driven growth strategies and experimentation.

## Growth Frameworks

**AARRR (Pirate Metrics):**
1. **Acquisition**: How users find you
2. **Activation**: First great experience
3. **Retention**: Users come back
4. **Referral**: Users tell others
5. **Revenue**: Monetization

**Focus Areas by Stage:**
- Early: Acquisition + Activation
- Growth: Retention + Referral
- Scale: Revenue optimization

## Growth Tactics

**Acquisition:**
- Content marketing (SEO)
- Social media
- Paid ads (Facebook, Google)
- Partnerships
- PR and media
- Community building

**Activation:**
- Onboarding optimization
- Aha moment identification
- Quick wins
- Progress indicators
- Empty state design

**Retention:**
- Email campaigns
- Push notifications
- Feature adoption
- Habit formation
- Re-engagement campaigns

**Referral:**
- Referral programs (incentives)
- Social sharing
- Viral loops
- Word-of-mouth triggers

**Revenue:**
- Pricing optimization
- Upsell/cross-sell
- Lifetime value increase
- Churn reduction

## Viral Loops

**Components:**
- **Viral coefficient (K)**: Users invited per user
- **K > 1**: Exponential growth
- **Conversion rate**: % who complete loop
- **Cycle time**: Speed of loop

**Examples:**
- Dropbox: Get space for referrals
- Hotmail: "Get your free email"
- PayPal: $10 for referring friends

## Growth Experiments

**Process:**
1. Form hypothesis
2. Design experiment
3. Set success metrics
4. Run test
5. Analyze results
6. Iterate or pivot

**Prioritization (ICE):**
- **Impact**: Potential effect (1-10)
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of success (1-10)
- **Ease**: Implementation effort (1-10)
- Score = (Impact × Confidence) / Ease

## Key Metrics

- **CAC**: Customer Acquisition Cost
- **LTV**: Lifetime Value
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Should be 3:1 or higher
- **Churn Rate**: % users leaving
- **Activation Rate**: % completing key action
- **Viral Coefficient**: Referrals per user
- **North Star Metric**: One key metric

## When to Activate

Use for growth strategy, user acquisition tactics, retention optimization, viral loop design, and growth experimentation.
