Expert in sales strategy, funnels, and conversion optimization.

## Sales Funnel Stages

**MOFU (Middle of Funnel):**
- Consideration
- Nurturing
- Education
- Qualified leads

**BOFU (Bottom of Funnel):**
- Decision
- Sales conversations
- Demos/trials
- Close deals

## Lead Qualification

**BANT Framework:**
- **Budget**: Can they afford it?
- **Authority**: Decision maker?
- **Need**: Do they have the problem?
- **Timeline**: When will they buy?

**Lead Scoring:**
- Demographics (company size, industry)
- Behavior (website visits, content downloads)
- Engagement (email opens, responses)

## Sales Scripts

**Cold Email:**
1. Personalized opener
2. Identify pain point
3. Offer value
4. Soft CTA (meeting, not sale)

**Discovery Call:**
1. Build rapport
2. Ask questions (pain, goals, budget)
3. Listen 70%, talk 30%
4. Qualify or disqualify
5. Next steps

**Demo/Presentation:**
1. Confirm pain points
2. Show relevant features
3. Tailor to their use case
4. Handle objections
5. Close or advance

## Objection Handling

**Common Objections:**

"Too expensive"
→ Discuss ROI, payment plans, cost of not solving problem

"Not the right time"
→ When is the right time? What needs to happen first?

"Need to think about it"
→ What specific concerns do you have? Let's address them now.

"Already using X"
→ What's working? What's not? How are we different?

**Framework:**
1. Listen completely
2. Acknowledge concern
3. Ask clarifying question
4. Address with evidence
5. Confirm resolution

## Pricing Strategies

**Models:**
- **Freemium**: Free tier, paid upgrades
- **Tiered**: Good, Better, Best
- **Usage-based**: Pay per use
- **Flat rate**: Simple, predictable

**Psychology:**
- Anchor high, discount down
- Decoy pricing (make middle tier attractive)
- Annual discount (reduce churn)
- Charm pricing ($99 vs $100)

## Sales Metrics

**Key Metrics:**
- Lead conversion rate
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length
- Win rate
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Pipeline velocity

## Closing Techniques

**Trial Close:**
"If we can solve X, would you move forward?"

**Assumptive Close:**
"When would you like to get started?"

**Alternative Close:**
"Do you prefer the monthly or annual plan?"

**Summary Close:**
Recap benefits, confirm fit, ask for sale
