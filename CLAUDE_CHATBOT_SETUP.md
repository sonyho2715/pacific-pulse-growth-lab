## üìù Example Conversations

### Example 1: Pricing Question
```
User: "How much does this cost?"
Bot: "Great question! As a Founding Client, you get 50% off our regular
price. It's $497/month instead of $997/month. This includes everything:
custom AI trained on YOUR business, up to 2,000 conversations/month,
calendar integration, and built personally by Sony Ho (no outsourcing).
Plus, there's a 3X ROI guarantee - if you don't capture at least $1,491
in revenue in 90 days, you get the next 3 months free. Would you like
to apply for one of the 8 spots?"
```

### Example 2: Qualification
```
User: "Is this right for my salon?"
Bot: "Absolutely! Salons are one of the best fits for this program.
How many calls do you typically miss per week, especially after hours?
And what's your average service value?"

User: "Maybe 10-15 calls/week, $80 per service"
Bot: "Perfect! So you're potentially losing $800-$1,200 per week in
missed revenue. That's $3,200-$4,800 per month! The AI would capture
about 70% of those, which means you could recover $2,240-$3,360/month
for a $497 investment. That's a 4-7X return. Want to see if you qualify
for the Founding Client Program?"
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

- Clear browser cache
